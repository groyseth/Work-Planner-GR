# Work-Planner-GR #

I started with utializing bootstrap to get my containers with the time, textarea and save button postion
I added the hours to the time blocks for an average work schedule from 9 to 5.
I moved on the my 'work.js' folder to work on the javascript.
I made a clock showing the current time on the top of the page.
The text blocks are color coded to the current time.
There is a save button to save your text and when you reload the page the text remains.
